# Citcom Label

The Citcom Label is an initiative currently under development within Citcom.ai. Its goal is to create a trusted, recognisable signal that helps AI providers demonstrate responsible practices and gives buyers—especially public-sector actors such as smart cities—a clearer basis for evaluating and procuring AI solutions.

## What will the Citcom Label be?

The label is envisioned as a **system of digital badges**, each representing a specific dimension of trustworthiness assessed during the evaluation process.  
These badges would include a **watermark**, ensuring authenticity and preventing misuse. Each badge would be **verifiable through the Citcom Hub**, allowing external stakeholders to confirm its origin, evaluation status, and associated criteria.

The Citcom badges are **not intended to function as legally binding conformity certificates under the AI Act**. Instead, they serve as **smart-city–oriented quality marks**, helping cities and other public authorities gain confidence in the AI solutions they consider adopting.

For AI innovators, the Citcom badge system provides **independent third-party validation**, helping them promote their solutions and demonstrate that they meet recognised standards of trustworthiness. For cities and public buyers, the badges offer **clear, evidence-based guidance** to support more informed and transparent procurement decisions.

## On what basis will the Citcom badges be awarded?

The detailed criteria are still being developed with Citcom partners, but several guiding principles are emerging:

### Completion of an evaluation  
A badge is expected to be awarded only once a solution completes a structured assessment aligned with shared guidelines for the relevant dimension of trustworthiness.

### Common methodology  
Work is ongoing to define a coherent framework that determines how systems are qualified, how requirements translate into test cases, and how results are interpreted across different trust dimensions.

### Success thresholds  
Initial discussions point toward setting minimum quantitative and qualitative thresholds that vary by product type, maturity level, and the specific dimension being assessed.

### Real-world validation  
Evaluations are expected to rely on practical or pilot scenarios using the actual product, ensuring that results reflect real-world behaviour.
