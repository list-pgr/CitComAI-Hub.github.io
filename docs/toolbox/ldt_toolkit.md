# Local Digital Twin Demonstrator

## Introduction

In the context of task 3.2, and more precisely related to the gap analysis performed by the Luxembourg TEF site, an evolution of its electromobility Local Digital Twin (LDT) is planned. This effort will culminate in the development of an LDT demonstrator which will be made available to showcase advancements in interoperability and AI-readiness.

The development process will follow several iterations, each aimed at progressively extending the digital twin's capabilities. These iterations align with the three twin models described in the section "Project Iterations & Twin Capabilities": the Descriptive Twin, the Predictive Twin, and the Prospective Twin. Each model builds upon the previous one, enhancing the ability to monitor, predict, and simulate real-world assets effectively.

The LDT demonstrator will be built using open-source components, ensuring transparency, accessibility, and community-driven development. Furthermore, it will align with the key standards and interfaces outlined in the EU LDT Toolbox, such as NGSI-LD and Smart Data Models, to guarantee interoperability and compliance with European frameworks.

## Project Iterations & Digital Twin Capabilities*

### Iteration 1: Descriptive Twin
- Presents the current and historical state of the real-world asset, including both static and dynamic characteristics.

### Iteration 2: Predictive Twin
- Builds on the descriptive twin by providing predictions of how the asset may evolve.

### Iteration 3: Prospective Twin
- Enables “what-if” analysis by allowing users to simulate the impact of potential actions on the asset.
