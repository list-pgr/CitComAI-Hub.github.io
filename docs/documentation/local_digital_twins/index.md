# Towards AI-ready & interoperable LDTs

Local Digital Twins (LDTs) are at the forefront of transforming how cities and communities leverage data and technology to address complex challenges. As the demand for AI-ready and interoperable systems grows, it becomes imperative to establish a unified approach that ensures seamless integration and collaboration across diverse LDT environments. This section introduces the collective efforts and strategic vision aimed at achieving this goal, setting the stage for the technical and strategic objectives outlined below. By fostering interoperability and aligning with open standards, we pave the way for scalable, sustainable, and innovative solutions that benefit both local and European-wide initiatives.

## Strategic Goals
- Assess Cross-Site Interoperability: Evaluate the feasibility and value of enhancing interoperability among LDTs across TEF sites
- Evolve LDTs: Recommend improvements to LDTs and explore common cross-site infrastructure (e.g., data spaces, AI model repositories)
- Define Joint Pilots: Identify and test pilots to validate proposed ideas in real-world scenarios

## Technical Goals
- Aligning with the EU LDT Toolbox, FIWARE and open standards like ETSI NGSI-LD
- Ensuring LDTs can seamlessly integrate AI models by providing structured, standardized, and accessible data
- Develop a “blueprint” for interoperable LDTs across TEF sites
- Identifying and standardizing thematic datasets to enable seamless cross-site data exchange
- Applying MIMs and best practices to ensure scalability and sustainability.


To facilitate collaboration and drive progress towards these goals, we established the LDT Club—a dedicated forum where stakeholders can share insights, align strategies, and collectively address challenges. This collaborative platform serves as a cornerstone for fostering innovation and ensuring that the transition to AI-ready and interoperable LDTs is both inclusive and effective.

Meeting minutes, recordings and further materials related to the LDT Club are available under https://imecinternational.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Citcom.aiTEF/Shared%20Documents/WP3%20-%20Infrastructure/T3.2/LDT%20Club?csf=1&web=1&e=zyhvcL.

## Scenario: CitCom.AI – EDIC LDT - CitiVerse

![Scenario](img/scenario.svg)

The scenario illustrated in the diagram above puts the LDT CitiVerse EDIC and CitCom.AI TEF sites in relation. While the EDIC aims at creating a federated network of Local Digital Twins (LDTs) across Europe, CitCom.AI leverages LDTs to test and integrate AI solutions, fostering innovation in Smart Cities and Communities.\
AI innovators begin by collaborating with CitCom.AI TEF sites, where they can access real-world LDT environments to develop, test, and validate their AI solutions. Ideally, these environments should provide standardized, interoperable data and infrastructure aligned with EU LDT Toolbox guidelines.\
Once solutions are successfully demonstrated within CitCom.AI, innovators can leverage the established interoperability and best practices to integrate their solutions into the broader EDIC federated LDT network. This pathway ensures that innovations are not only tested in realistic scenarios but are also ready for seamless adoption and scaling across multiple European cities and communities through the EDIC framework.\
To ensure interoperability, the CitCom.AI LDTs, currently a set of heterogeneous and independent systems, should adopt common standards and frameworks outlined in the EU LDT Toolbox. This includes aligning data models, APIs, and communication protocols to enable seamless integration and collaboration across the EDIC federated LDT network.\
Conducting a gap analysis between CitCom.AI LDTs and the EU LDT Toolbox is crucial to identify areas where alignment is needed. This analysis will help pinpoint discrepancies in data models, APIs, and communication protocols, ensuring that AI solutions tested within CitComAI can transition seamlessly to the EDIC federated network. By addressing these gaps, the pathway for AI innovators to scale their solutions across Europe becomes more efficient and less fragmented.\

## How to start with a gap analysis?

![Template](img/template.jpg)

The diagram above illustrates the different layers and tools of the EU LDT Toolbox. Each sticky note at the border of the  diagram links a question about your existing LDT with the relevant layer of the EU LDT Toolbox. Answering these questions provides a structured starting point for further elaboration of a gap analysis, helping to identify areas where alignment with the toolbox is needed.

**Question:** \
Elaborate whether you use or plan to use AI in your LDT. If yes, what kind of AI (LLMs, predictive models, classifiers etc.) and for what purpose?\
**Answer:**\
Yes, BIPED explicitly plans to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in its Local Digital Twin (LDT). The
project envisions "Future-Ready Intelligent Twins" that will leverage AI to:
- Learn and make real-time accurate insights and predictions.
- Accurately align real-time operational decisions with longer-term policy.
BiPED considers the definition of AI as stated in the AI Watch – determining Artificial
Intelligence 2.0 by the European Comission.
While specific types of AI like LLMs or classifiers are not explicitly detailed, the focus on
"predictions" strongly indicates the use of predictive models. Forecast models are the
primary AI models in BiPED currently.
The project also considers AI from a regulatory perspective, referencing the "AI Act" in its Data
Management Plan, suggesting a structured approach to AI integration.

**Question:** \
